Strategies 

1) Playing Strategy  

The objective of the game is to complete the bid by winning the required number of tricks. 
Thus, always take a good look at the hand before placing your bid. Make a high bid if you 
have good amount Kings, Aces and other high cards and you are confident that they can get 
you a lot of tricks. If you do not have that many high cards, the bid should always be low.  

If the total number of bids placed by all the players is lower than 11 then it is evident 
that you have to bag your opponents. This can be done by getting rid of all the cards that 
you did not count as a bid. Try to win a trick ONLY with the card you counted while placing 
the bid.  

If the total number of bids placed is more than 12 then you should lead your short suits 
first so you can start spading. Clearly there are not many bags in the game when a high 
number of bid is made.  

If the number of bids are between 11 and 12 it is wise to win your tricks early and be 
in a safe zone.    

2) Sandbagging  

Avoid winning too many tricks above your bid. Every time a partnership wins 10 bags they 
get a 100 point penalty.

You can use this against your opponents by playing lower cards and making them win the trick 
so they can get as many bags as possible.  

3) Playing Nil  

When you bid nil, try to get rid of all the higher cards without winning the trick. This 
leaves you with lower cards towards the end of the game and you have a higher probability 
of not winning any tricks with them   

4) Playing tips  

a) If you are trying to win a trick, never lead the King if the Ace of that suit has not 
been played yet. 

b) Lead your short suits first, this gives you a choice to win or lose a trick later 

c) Try to get the middle cards like 8s and 9s out of your way so you are left with higher 
cards by the end of the game
